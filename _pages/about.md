I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Prof. Heng Huang](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~heng). I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Sichuan University in 2025, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tao He](https://ithet1007.github.io). 

My research interests span a broad range of topics, including computer vision, building trustworthy and reliable machine learning models, and reinforcement learning.
